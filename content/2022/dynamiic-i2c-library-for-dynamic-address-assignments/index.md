description: "This still-in-progress project takes a modern spin on the Numitron, a '70s-era seven-segment display. Instead of incandescent filaments, this display module uses LED replacements found in modern 'Edison'-style LED light bulbs. Each display contains 16 secments and may be daisy chained to form long strings of text (Latin alphabet) or numbers (Aribic numerals). They're also fast and have individual segment brightness control, allowing interesting animations."
